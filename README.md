# Replica Manager for a Replica Group of Fault tolerant and highly available Distributed Systems 
The Replica Manager is responsible for restoring the server in case of crash failure. In such situation, the replica manager identifies the crash and then restarts the server. It will also fetch data from other replicas and pass that on to the restored replicas.
